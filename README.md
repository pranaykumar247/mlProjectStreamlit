- Models and Predictions page
- About Us section

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (for creating virtual environment)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.6 or later)






### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pranaykumar247/mlProjectStreamlit
```

2. Create virtual environment
```
conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y
```

3. Run the requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the streamlit file
```
streamlit run app.py
```


# Pages
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, users can upload their datasets using the drag and drop functionality. The app will perform basic exploratory data analysis, display summary statistics, and visualize data distributions.

## Plots and Visualizations
Users can generate various plots and visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and line charts. The app provides an interactive interface to customize the plot settings.

## Models and Predictions
This section allows users to build, train, and test machine learning models on their uploaded datasets. Users can select algorithms, set hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance.
